# Manual .env Setup Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Keep Your API Key Private!

This file contains NO API keys. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy it (it starts with: sk-or-v1-...)

### Step 2: Create .env File
1. Open `backend` folder
2. Create a new file named `.env` (with the dot)
3. Add these three lines (replace YOUR_KEY with your actual key):

```
PORT=5000
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
OPENROUTER_MODEL=xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free
```

### Step 3: Verify .env is Protected
- Check that `backend/.env` is listed in `.gitignore`
- NEVER commit the `.env` file to git
- NEVER share your API key in any file that gets committed

### Step 4: Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY RULES

❌ NEVER put API keys in:
- .bat files

## If You Exposed a Key by Accident

1. Go to OpenRouter and delete the exposed key immediately
2. Create a new key
3. Update your local `.env` file only
4. Never commit `.env` to git

**Remember: Your `.env` file should NEVER be on GitHub!**
